WS282x_Programmer
=================

Arduino sketch for programming and testing WS282x LED controllers
I'm new to the Github, but have been trying to make this sketch work on my Uno, but I seem to get stuck on the programming
of the chips, any one figured this out yet and can shine some LED light on it ? 
be aware that 0xD2 is the right one for the stop byte of the ws2821 after a reprogram block, but the type selection is a little muddled up 
not a biggy, but be aware of the numbers
